## Motivation

I decided to undergo this project for the joy of it, and game development is a hobby of mine. I have always been fascinated by the complex programs that are video games, and I wanted to get a deeper sense of how their inner-workings function. In this project I had to implement a wide-array of complicated systems; graphics, physics, and audio, all in their own right respectable challenges with a lot of theory behind them. Together they create a robust system that can create virtual worlds and interactive gameplay.
